# Portfolio Website

## About the Project
Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm excited to share my work with you, all carefully crafted using the latest web development technologies. Built from the ground up with React as the foundation, this site is also powered by the precision of TypeScript and the simplicity of Tailwind for styling, all thanks to the speed and efficiency of Vite. Take a look around to see what projects I've been working on that showcase my skills in building high-quality web applications.
