    "about-me": "I analyze. I code. I tinker. Technology is growing at a boundless rate. As a Software Engineer, it is necessary to be on pace with technology because you may never know when you may find it useful in your project. I am passionate for Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Full Stack Development. I enjoy learning new languages, frameworks, and tools because it expands my toolset to aid in analyzing and finding a valid solution to a problem. I also enjoy developing applications which simplifies and makes people's lives much more efficient. Seeing my own work being used as intended is the best satisfaction I can ever receive. Knowing I made a difference in someone's life with the code I wrote is priceless to me."
